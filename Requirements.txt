Functional requirement:
This application will be very similar to TodoApplication.

Will again 2 extra tabs to Navigation bar:
List -> which displays all books.
Form -> Form to add new books.

book should have name, date (keep it as a string), author full name

Nonfunctional requirements:
1. 2 different data saving modes
   Json file -> use json file to load data.
   Memory -> use AddSingleton dependency injection.

   There two different classes should use the same interface
2. Have writing/reading data in separate file (service) rather than controller.


Advanced optional:
	-1. Add new tab in navigation bar "Authors" -> the page just lists all the authors in the books
	0. Add new saving mode - which would save data into .text file
	1. Be able to configure Json, Text, or Memory storage in appsettings.json
	2. Non-function -> the controllers should be minimal -> All main jobs should be done in service classes.
